 ### Matrix Multiplication with Unix Shared Memory 
 This is my implementation for http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/PROG/PG4/prog4.html
 
 ***Note:*** in the assignment it says " When program compute runs, it receives a row number Row and a column number Column from its command line arguments. " I also send to the program other parameters to make it more efficient these parameters are the number of rows and columns of both matrices to make it more efficient (switching to original version should be easay)
